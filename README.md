# Vertical Teleport
Configured block type (Default: LODESTONE) now acts as a instant "elevator" for vertical traversal.

To set up an "elevator":
1. Place two of the configured block types at preferred Y-levels within the same column
2. Make sure the two blocks above each "elevator" block may safely contain a player (no LAVA, no solid blocks)

To use an "elevator":
1. Stand on an "elevator" block
2. To go UP to another "elevator" block, right click the "elevator" block you're standing on
3. To go DOWN to another "elevator" block, left click the "elevator" block you're standing on
